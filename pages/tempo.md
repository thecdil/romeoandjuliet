*Inner and Outer Tempo
Sometimes these will match and sometimes not. As people we very often hide what is going on inside us. Revealing ourselves in such an open way, would be too exposing in most situations; one could argue this is another survival mechanism, that we use to protect ourselves. This is why being aware of inner and outer tempi is important: understanding the moments when they are the same, but also when one covers another or perhaps the most interesting, when our inner tempo bursts through to alter our outer tempo. Those wonderful ‘bubbles’ that build and build inside until they burst through! So many scenes are rooted in this delicious conflict and the way in which we reveal this as actors again (amongst other things) relies on our physical awareness. How can I reveal this inner tempo physically as it bubbles to the surface? What physical crutches does my character use to protect their inner tempo? How does the line have one tempo/say one thing, whilst my characters physicality reveals another (tempo)?

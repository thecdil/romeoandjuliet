# dramaturgy

`dramaturgy` translates the prototypical dramaturgy packet, created for a hypothetical production of William Shakespeare's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, into a digital space. 
This site is a collaborative project between the graduate level Dramaturgical Acts course in the [Department of Theatre](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/theatre) at the University of Idaho and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). 

**Questions that guided our research were:** 

1. How do we understand the data we use in the field of dramaturgy? 
2. How can we use the tools of the digital humanities to advance understandings of the field of production dramaturgy and vice versa? 
3. What tools or manners of visualizing dramaturgical research might be helpful to those who work on a production of play?

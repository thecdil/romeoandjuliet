### Music and Dance in the Original Text

Several times through the action of the play, the characters speak of or to the act of singing and dancing. There are many words that would suggest singing and dancing such as “roundel” for dance. However, the context of the meaning of the words that convey the action of singing or dancing can also shift the interpretation based on the characters and what action they mean to convey. In Act 4, when Bottom thinks to himself to ask Peter Quince to make a “ballad” of his dream, he is speaking of a ballad type poem set to music (today’s opera). When he says “sing” he means to deliver prose through affected speech like reading poetry but we might hear that phrase today to mean he would sing a song or aria.  Whereas, in Act 5, Theseus asks “what masques, what dances” - when you look up the definition of [Masques](https://www.britannica.com/art/masque) you can see they were staged dances popular in this period - but they told stories (today’s ballet) whereas dance was not required to do so. Below are some examples of discussions of music and dance in the play.

### Exercise  
Can you identify other characters that refer to song or dance? Which characters do not?  When in your own speech or writing to words change in context? How could you interpret these lines in your everyday life? For example: when I read Theseus’ lines asking for entertainment - I can see him with a remote control looking for just the right channel to watch before bedtime.  

### *A Midsummer Night's Dream* in Music
Henry Purcell, British composer, wrote [*The Fairy Queen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAvS3AypQfI), a semi-operatic adaptation  in 1692. Purcell added music and “masques” for each Act. (Again, [Masques](https://www.britannica.com/art/masque) were staged dances of the period.) Purcell did not use Shakespeare’s original text. The text for Purcell’s work is loosely based on the story but with additional characters and none of Shakespeare’s original characters sing (Savage, 1973). Listen to this [scene](https://youtu.be/QAvS3AypQfI?t=7972.) which could be the equivalent of:  

### Act 5 Scene 1, Lines 30-31 [link to datalines: 68867-68] 

Theseus: Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love 

Accompany your hearts! 

 

Felix Mendelssohn, German composer, read the play when he was 17 and wrote the [E major, Op. 21 overture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43GQAj8Mg00) in 1827. This adaptation was not an opera and was intended as music only with no text. In 1843 Mendelssohn returned to A Midsummer Night’s Dream and wrote additional musical pieces to accompany a production of the play. Unlike Purcell, these Mendelssohn compositions are directly influenced and referencing Shakespeare’s text (Kimber quoting Botstein, 2006).  [cross link to Rachael’s article?] 

 

Listen to this linked section of music while reading the following text in Act 1, Scene 2 starting with Quince: “Is all our company here.” [link to dataline 67263] 

[Clown Theme](https://soundcloud.com/kerronhislop/motive-5/s-hXwpZ). In this excerpt listen to how Mendelssohn underscores the stage directions and captures the characterization of Bottom and future transition of Bottom into an Ass.  

Mendelssohn’s music comes alive in the play.  His compositions are so moving, that they are quite recognizable out of context. You might be familiar with the famous [Wedding March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reu4GvUjm5o.) which could be used to depict the entrance of the court in Act 5, Scene 1. [link to dataline 68836] 

Benjamin Britten, British composer, wrote the most popular operatic adaptation of *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* in 1960.   Britten is credited as the only operatic adaptation to use the original text of Shakespeare. (Cooke, 1993). He worked closely with British Tenor Peter Pears  as his librettist collaborator. Watch this [excerpt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REvUZvwnFIc) of the most famous aria from the opera: Oberon singing to Puck in Act II, Sc. 1. Read the text while he sings and see if you can notice the literal alignment of music and lyrics. He is creating a lullaby-like quality to  depict how other characters are sleeping and thus he will use the magic of the flower to change how they wake.    

 

[link to datalines: 67629-67649] 

I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, 

Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, 

Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, 

With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine: 

There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, 

Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight, 

And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, 

Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in: 

And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, 

And make her full of hateful fantasies. 

Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove: 

A sweet Athenian lady is in love 

With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes, 

But do it when the next thing he espies 

May be the lady: thou shalt know the man 

By the Athenian garments he hath on. 

Effect it with some care, that he may prove 

More fond on her than she upon her love: 

And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow. 

Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so. 

 
### Exercise  
The Composer’s listed above used their imagination while reading the play in order to compose music - let’s try to see what happens if you physicalize the poetry. What would happen if you read the text as poetry over the music? What pictures, colors, and emotions begin to take shape in your imagination? Does the music and/or the text implore you to move or create? Allow yourself to improvise through singing, drawing, dancing, or acting as you read and listen. Additional Exercise: What songs from your favorite artists would work for each character? Create a current “opera” using contemporary music.  

### *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* in Ballet 

Mendelssohn’s music inspired several ballet versions of the story.  The two most famous and ballet adaptations were choreographed and set by George Balanchine in 1962 and Frederick Ashton in 1964. For Balanchine, choreographer for the New York City Ballet, this would be his first full-length ballet. Balanchine was inspired by the play and Mendelssohn’s music, and included additional works by the composer in the ballet he choreographed (Balanchine Trust, 2020).  Watch the [following excerpt](https://youtu.be/ZrfiusNHCls?t=2870) of the same Clown scene to see how the body is used to physicalize the comedic character of Bottom and his transition as a bumbling human to braying Donkey.  

Frederick Ashton, British Choreographer, was a contemporary of Balanchine.  The two choreographers were inspired by each other and their work includes several hidden references to each other (MacCauley, 2018).  Ashton used only original music written by Mendelssohn for the play.  He cut bits of Shakespeare’s text to make it one act ballet that is less than an hour and titled the work The Dream.  Watch the [another excerpt](https://youtu.be/s3APvyV9q2Q?t=1155) of the Clown and see how Ashton envisions the movement differently.     

### Exercise  
Watch the full performance of both interpretations. What do these two versions teach us about the central story?  What does each production highlight?  Differences?  Similarities?

Often, the first thing people learn about us is our name. Of course our names (first and last) can have an impact; they are part of how the world sees us and often how we see ourselves. 
Our family name (surname/last name) carries with it part of our history-where we've come from both in the world, but also genetically.

However, is that what Juliet is really saying here? The major factor keeping Romeo and Juliet apart is their families' fued. If Romeo where from any other family they could be together. So by casting off his name, he would essentially be leaving his family so he could be with her.

How important is your name to you? How important is your family to you? Could you leave your family behind, just o be with someone you love?

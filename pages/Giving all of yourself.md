**Giving all of yourself**
## mind, body, soul.


When you are in a relationship, do you give all of yourself?
Or do you hold back?
Is it because you are afraid?
Fear is the biggest reason why people hold back in relationships.
Fear of not being loved for who you are.
Fear of being judged.
Fear of giving so much and not receiving the same in return.
Fear of being hurtâ€¦again.
The truth is there is nothing anyone can ever do that can take away from who you truly are.
You are Divine Perfection.
Yes, you.
Regardless of how you look, where you come from and what you have done.
When you give all of yourself, do you give with the expectation that you will receive something in return?
Or do you give for the sheer joy of giving?
For the love of Be-ing?
For simply Be-ing.
When you give all of yourself without expectation, without attachment, that is when you experience Unconditional Love.
Love that has no conditions attached to it.
Love that is absolute.
Pure. Profound. Divine.
Have you experienced such Love?
Yes, it does exist.
It exists in every relationship.
And it begins with you.
So the next time you are with someone, give all of yourself.
Without conditions. Without expectations. Without attachments.
And watch what happens.
